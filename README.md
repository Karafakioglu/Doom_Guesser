# Doom Guesser

## This is one of the FullStack Projects in Codecademy.com. It can be described as:
<p> For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking. <p>
 
### Things to add later
    - As I learn DOM and how to manipulate DOM with JS I will turn into a website using HTML/CSS and JS
    - Enhance the possibilities
    - Let the user enter their own choices so they can customize what they want to do with it in the website
